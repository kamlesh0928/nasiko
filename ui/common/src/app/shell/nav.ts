 * The sidebar's items (plans/feat-app-shell.md §3): one source for AppSidebar and its tests.

 * and Settings is a footer row too. Deploy and Builds belong to Agents (its sub-nav), so they mark it current.
 *
 * `shared` items carry the shared context (window, filters, compare) between them through
 * `pickShared` (src/app/shell/context.ts), as the old header nav did.
