/**
 * The one- or two-sentence answer under a flow's title (plans/feat-flows.md F5): why it was slow, where it failed or
 * waited. Pure; only facts the data proves; each clause lists the calls it talks about (by `Call.key`) so the page can
 * link it to their step rows.
 *
 * Order: the outcome (failed / waiting / running / took), then at most one supporting fact (the call that took the
 * biggest share, or a fan-out). Failure reasons go through `reason()`, never the server's raw text (F15).
