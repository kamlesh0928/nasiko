/**
 * Which pending request a waiting call is (plans/feat-flows.md F20, eng review O2): a request names its chat
 * (`execution.context_id`, or `chat_session_id`) and its agent, never a flow, so it's the one pending request whose
 * chat and agent both match. Exactly one, or none: two candidates are ambiguous and the page sends the user to chat's
 * Waiting view instead.
