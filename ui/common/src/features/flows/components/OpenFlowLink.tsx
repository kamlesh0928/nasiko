/**
 * "Open flow" (plans/feat-flows.md F19): one link into a flow from wherever its request shows up (the trace page,
 * a Sessions row, chat's Activity, a workflow run step). A flow's id is its trace id, so the link goes straight to
 * `/flows/<id>`; an id with no flow (a trace that never went through the proxy) lands on the flow page's not-found
 * state, which says why.
