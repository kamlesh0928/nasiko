/**
 * What optimisation did to this conversation.
 *
 * Two different facts, and the distinction matters: the **setting** that governed how much history
 * each message carried, and the **measured** tokens trimmed out of this session's calls. The first
 * is always knowable; the second only exists once a layer that records its savings has run.
 *
 * Shown on the session page because savings recur per turn — a long conversation compounds them in
 * a way a per-call view understates, and this is where someone looks when they suspect optimisation
 * changed an answer.
