/**
 * Marks a feature that is new and still being validated.

 * deserves to know the behaviour is young — and that the answer is reversible.
 *
 * One component rather than a sentence written three times: a disclaimer that is worded slightly
 * differently in each place reads as three different degrees of caution, when the intent is one.
 *
 * Deliberately a quiet badge and a short line, not a warning banner. These features are safe — the
 * worst case is a smaller saving than expected, not a broken agent — and dressing that up as a
