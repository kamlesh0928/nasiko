//! The shared Resume Dispatcher (M6) — turns a resolved `hitl_requests` row
//! into an actual push into the paused conversation, closing the gap M5 left
//! open ("resolving a row today has no effect an agent could ever observe").
//!
//! Shared across every `HitlOrigin`, not MCP-specific: this module only knows
//! how to claim a resolved row and hand it to a [`ResumeNotifier`] — it has no
//! opinion on *how* delivery happens, deliberately, so `direct_chat`/
//! `orchestrator`/`maf` origins can reuse the same claim/lease machinery with
//! a different notifier later. `crate::notifier::RuntimeResumeNotifier` is
//! the one concrete transport this milestone ships, proven against MCP's
//! `mcp_tool` origin.
//!
//! Structurally mirrors `oss/server/src/agents/build_worker.rs`: a poll loop
//! that drains the claim queue on each tick, a slower periodic sweep that
//! quarantines abandoned claims, and panic isolation around the per-row work
//! so one bad row can't take down the loop.
