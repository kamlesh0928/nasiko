//! The one concrete [`crate::dispatcher::ResumeNotifier`] this milestone
//! ships: pushes a resolved decision into the paused agent by resolving its
//! live address via `ContainerRuntime::endpoint()` (the same primitive
//! `oss/server/src/agent_proxy.rs` and `a2a_dispatch.rs::resolve_endpoint`
//! already use) and making a fresh outbound A2A `SendMessage` call carrying
//! the row's `context_id`.
//!
//! There is no reusable event bus and no A2A push-notification support
//! anywhere in this codebase (confirmed in the M6 handoff investigation) —
//! the original `tools/call` HTTP response is long gone by the time a human
//! resolves a request, so this cannot "wake up" anything already listening.
//! It has to be a brand-new connection into the agent, exactly like this.
