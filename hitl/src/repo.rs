//! Postgres persistence for `hitl_requests` (migration `0007_hitl.sql` +
//! `0022_hitl_auth_required.sql`).
//!
//! `oss/mcp-gateway` calls `create_pending_auth_required`/`create_pending_auth_required_with_ttl`
//! from `protocol::handle_auth_required` and `create_pending_tool_approval`/
//! `create_pending_tool_approval_with_ttl` from `protocol::create_tool_approval_id`. `resolve`
//! (used directly by tests, and indirectly via `HitlStore::resolve` in production — see
//! `store.rs`) never triggers a retry, a push, or a session grant — it only flips the row's own
//! status; `claim_for_resume`/`finish_resume`/`recover_stuck_resumes` (M6) are the resume
//! dispatcher's own claim/lease primitives, consumed by `crate::dispatcher`. The `/api/hitl/*`
//! human-facing API (`oss/server/src/router/hitl.rs`) goes entirely through the `HitlStore` trait
//! (`store.rs`) and `authz::authorize_hitl_action` — `HitlRequestRow`/`HitlError`/
//! `TryFrom<HitlRequestRow>` are shared with `store.rs` rather than duplicated here.
