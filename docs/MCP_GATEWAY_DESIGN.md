## 1. Executive Summary

The MCP Gateway is the platform's single tool-calling surface for every deployed agent. It gives an agent one fixed, permanent URL through which it can reach every tool the agent's caller has connected — whether that tool is a pre-built SaaS integration (Composio: Gmail, Slack, GitHub, Google Calendar, …) or a custom, self-hosted MCP server someone on the platform registered.

Adding, removing, sharing, or restricting a tool is a data change, not a code change. No agent is ever redeployed or reconfigured when the set of tools available to its caller changes. The gateway resolves, on every single request, exactly who is calling, what they are allowed to reach, and how to authenticate and forward that call — merging everything into one unified Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool surface.

This document describes the complete, decided architecture: the request-time identity model, the Postgres schema (unified connector registry with owner-controlled sharing), the caching and permission-resolution pipeline, and the security hardening applied to the design after a dedicated audit pass.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

An agent is only as useful as the actions it can take in the outside world — sending an email, searching the web, querying an internal system, calling a company API. Every one of those actions is a distinct **tool**, typically gated behind its own authentication scheme and typically tied to one specific person's account, not the agent's.

Without a centralized gateway, each agent — and each agent's author — would have to solve the same set of problems independently and repeatedly:

- Where do credentials for third-party services live, and how are they kept safe?
- How does a token get refreshed before it expires, without the agent ever noticing?
- Who is allowed to use which tool, and how is that enforced per call, not just per deployment?
- If two different tool backends both happen to define a tool with the same name, how do calls not collide?
- How does a person share a tool they've configured with someone else, without handing over their own login?

Solving these per-agent does not scale, and it is a security liability — credentials scattered across many independently-built, independently-trusted agent containers instead of concentrated in one hardened, auditable service.

**The MCP Gateway exists to make "give this agent a new capability" a configuration action — safe, permissioned, instantaneous, and requiring zero changes to the agent's own code.**

---

## 3. Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals

- **One fixed URL** every agent uses for every tool call, for the lifetime of that agent, regardless of how many tools or providers sit behind it.
- **Two tool-provider kinds, one interface:**
  - *Composio-backed integrations* — pre-built SaaS connectors, OAuth handled by Composio's own infrastructure.
  - *Custom MCP servers* — self-hosted or third-party servers speaking the Model Context Protocol directly, with the platform handling OAuth 2.1 / API key / basic-auth / URL-parameter authentication itself.
- **Per-user credentials, always.** Sharing a tool with someone never shares the underlying login — everyone connects with their own account.
- **Per-agent, per-user, per-tool permission control** — allow, ask-for-approval, or block, expressible down to a single tool via glob patterns.
- **Owner-controlled sharing** of custom MCP servers — by username or platform-wide — mirroring the sharing model the platform already uses for agents.
- **Zero plaintext credentials.** Every stored secret is encrypted at rest with a per-user key.
- **Instant permission propagation.** A permission change must be visible on the very next tool call, not after some cache-expiry delay.

### Non-Goals

- This is not a general-purpose API gateway or reverse proxy — its scope is exclusively the MCP tool-calling surface.
- It does not manage agent deployment, builds, or agent-to-agent orchestration; those are handled by other platform subsystems and are explicitly out of scope here.
- It does not replace the platform's existing agent-to-agent access control (`agent_grants`/`agent_acl`) — it reuses that model's *shape* for a different resource, but does not touch or duplicate it.

## 4. Core Concepts & Terminology

A single naming rule governs every table, field, and conversation about this system — it exists specifically to prevent the two provider kinds from being confused with each other:

| Term | Meaning | Never means |
|---|---|---|
| **Toolkit** | A Composio-specific integration (e.g. the Gmail toolkit, the Slack toolkit) | A custom MCP server |
| **MCP server** | A self-hosted or third-party server speaking MCP directly | A Composio integration |
| **Connector** | The neutral umbrella term used only where a table or concept must represent *either* kind | A synonym for "toolkit" |

Every table or API response that uses "connector" always carries an explicit `provider_type` discriminator (`composio` or `mcp_server`) — the ambiguity lives in one column value, never in a name.

**Other core concepts:**

- **Connector** — one row in the registry representing either a Composio integration or a custom MCP server.
- **Ownership** — Composio connectors have no owner (always globally available; every user connects their own account to it). Custom MCP server connectors always have an owner — even one registered by a platform admin — and are private until explicitly shared.
- **Grant** — a record that an owner has shared their connector with a specific user (by username) or with everyone on the platform.
- **Connection** — one person's own credential/session state for a connector. Never shared, even when the connector itself is.
- **Permission** — for a given (caller, agent, connector) triple: whether the connector is enabled for that agent at all, and whether any individual tool within it is allowed, blocked, or requires approval.
- **Agent gateway token** — the per-agent credential minted at deploy time and injected into the container env (`MCP_GATEWAY_TOKEN`); the agent presents it as a `Bearer` header on every gateway call to prove *which agent* is calling. It never names a user. MCP clients that can only be handed a URL (no header hook) can instead use the pre-composed `MCP_GATEWAY_CONNECT_URL`, which carries the same credential in the path at `POST /api/mcp/s/{token}` and is subject to identical checks — the header form is preferred where the client supports it.
- **Flow-bound user identity** — the *for whom*: resolved server-side from the request's `traceparent`, whose trace id names the `flows` row (carrying `user_id`) that the platform wrote when it dispatched the flow to this agent. The gateway authorizes a `tools/call` only when the authenticated agent is a recorded `flow_participants` member of that flow.

---

## 5. High-Level Architecture

**This is a single-server design.** All identity validation, agent proxying, and MCP routing run inside one process — the control-plane server. There is no separate edge/proxy service in front of it; the server's own middleware layers are the trust boundary. This is a deliberate simplicity choice: one process to operate, one fewer network hop, one fewer place for a trust decision to be implemented inconsistently.

```mermaid

    LOGIC --> CO
    LOGIC --> GEN
    PROXY -->|invoke agent + traceparent| A1
    A1 -->|"MCP JSON-RPC + Bearer token + traceparent"| MCPMW
```

**Two request paths, both terminating in the same process:**

1. **Agent runtime calls (the hot path).** Agent → the server's `/api/mcp` endpoint with its deploy-time `MCP_GATEWAY_TOKEN` (`Authorization: Bearer`) and the forwarded `traceparent` → the handler authenticates the agent against the stored token hash, then resolves the *user* from the flow record the traceparent names, requiring the agent to be a recorded participant of that flow. This route is deliberately **not** behind the normal session-JWT middleware — an agent never holds a user's real session credential (the agent-proxy module strips `Authorization`/`Cookie` before ever forwarding a request to an agent container, specifically so an agent can never replay a user's platform credentials).
2. **Management / UI calls.** A person's own session JWT → the normal session-auth middleware → MCP management routes (connect, share, configure permissions, browse the catalog) — the same authentication path every other management route on the platform already uses.

**The two-layer *code* split (independent of the single-process deployment above):**

- **A pure logic layer** — a standalone library crate with no knowledge of HTTP, web frameworks, or authentication. It only answers questions like "what can this caller reach" and "how do I format this specific tool call." This is what allows the gateway's behavior to be extended (as the Nasiko enterprise edition does) without copy-pasting business logic.
- **A thin routing layer** on top, inside the server, responsible only for identity extraction, access-control gating, and shaping the HTTP response.

Every function in the logic layer takes plain values (a user id, an agent id) and never a web-framework type — this is what keeps it testable and reusable independent of how a request physically arrived, even though today everything runs in one process.

**The governing rule for the crate/route split:** a function belongs in the crate unless it specifically needs a session JWT, an access-control check, usage tracking, or flow-event publishing — in which case, and only in which case, it stays in the thin route layer inside `server`. Every route handler reduces to: extract identity → check access → call into the crate → shape the response.

## 7. Identity & Security Model

### 7.1 The core constraint

An agent is **untrusted, user-authored code**. It is deployed once but serves requests from many different users over its lifetime. Identity therefore cannot be baked into the agent at deploy time — it must be established **per request**. And an agent must never be able to impersonate a different user, or borrow a different agent's tool permissions.

### 7.2 Two factors: agent credential + flow-bound user identity

The server solves this with two independent factors that each travel for free (design rationale and security analysis: the "MCP Gateway Agent Auth" design doc):

- **Agent identity** — a per-agent gateway credential minted at deploy time and injected into the container env as `MCP_GATEWAY_TOKEN` (alongside `MCP_GATEWAY_URL`). Only its SHA-256 hash is stored (`agent_gateway_tokens`); the plaintext exists solely in the container env. Every redeploy rotates it; destroying the agent tombstones it. The agent configures its MCP client **once at startup** with `Authorization: Bearer $MCP_GATEWAY_TOKEN` — no per-request plumbing.
- **User identity** — resolved server-side from the request's `traceparent`: its trace id names the `flows` row (carrying `user_id`) the platform wrote synchronously when it dispatched the flow, and the `flow_participants` record proves the flow was actually dispatched *to this agent*. The caller's real session credential (`Authorization`, `Cookie`) is still stripped before any request reaches an agent container — an agent can never replay a user's platform credentials.

Authorization rules, in order, all failing **closed**:

1. Bearer token missing / unknown / revoked → `401`.
2. `tools/list` (and `initialize`/`ping`) → allowed with **agent-only** identity: read-only metadata, so agents can discover tools at startup, outside any flow.
3. `tools/call` with no `traceparent`, an unknown trace id, or a flow no longer live → `403`. Presence is not the check — resolution is; there is nothing an agent can fabricate to pass.
4. `tools/call` where the authenticated agent is **not** a recorded participant of the flow → `403`.
5. Identity store unreachable → `403` — fail closed.
6. Otherwise: resolve `user_id` from the flow record and evaluate permissions exactly as before — the intersection of the user's grants and the agent's connector access.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User (session JWT)
    participant S as Server — dispatch (proxy / a2a)
    participant A as Agent Container
    participant M as Server — /api/mcp route

    U->>S: Invoke agent (Bearer session JWT)
    S->>S: Validate JWT, resolve user identity
    S->>S: Write flows row (user_id) + flow_participants += agent
    S->>A: Forward invocation + traceparent<br/>(caller's real session credential stripped; no per-request token)
    A->>M: POST /api/mcp (tools/call) + Bearer MCP_GATEWAY_TOKEN + traceparent
    M->>M: hash(token) → agent identity (401 if unknown/revoked)
    M->>M: traceparent → live flows row → user identity<br/>(403 unless agent ∈ flow_participants)
    M-->>A: Result, filtered by user grants ∩ agent connector access
```

**Why this is safe:** both designs' trust root is the server asserting the (user, agent) pair at dispatch time — this one carries the assertion in server-side state only the control plane can write, instead of a bearer JWT. A leaked traceparent is useless without the agent credential; a leaked agent credential only opens `tools/list` on the agent's own grants plus `tools/call` for flows actively routed through that agent — and it is instantly revocable (tombstone the token row, or complete the flow).

### 7.3 Encryption at rest

Every credential the gateway ever stores — API keys, OAuth access tokens, refresh tokens — is encrypted before it reaches the database, using a key derived per-user. Nothing is ever stored in plaintext, and credential fields are write-only at the API level: no endpoint ever returns a stored credential's value, only its presence/status.

### 7.4 SSRF protection

A user can register a custom MCP server at an arbitrary URL. Two protections apply before the platform will ever make a request to it:

1. **Registration-time validation** — the URL is resolved and checked against private, loopback, link-local, and metadata-endpoint address ranges before the server is ever saved.
2. **Connect-time pinning** — the actual outbound HTTP client used for custom-server traffic resolves DNS itself and rejects any address that fails the same check *at the moment of connection*, not just at registration. This closes the DNS-rebinding gap where a hostname could legitimately resolve to a public address at registration time and a private one later.

### 7.5 Least-privilege default

Nothing is visible, connected, or usable by default. A custom MCP server is invisible to everyone but its owner until an explicit grant exists. Ownership and grants gate *visibility* before any tool-level permission is even consulted — a two-layer check, described fully in §12.

---

## 8. Data Model (Postgres Schema)

### 8.1 Design principles

- **Reuse the platform's existing identity tables.** Every reference to "who" or "which agent" is a foreign key into the platform's existing `users` and `agents` tables — nothing about identity is duplicated anywhere in this schema.
- **One registry, not two.** Composio integrations and custom MCP servers live in a single table, distinguished by a `provider_type` discriminator. This is a deliberate fix over an earlier two-table design: a single downstream reference column cannot cleanly point at two different parent tables, and a shared registry avoids that structural problem entirely.
- **Cascading cleanup, deliberate exceptions.** Deleting a connector automatically removes every dependent row (grants, connections, tool catalog entries, permission overrides). Deleting the *owner* of a still-shared connector is the one deliberate exception — it is blocked, not cascaded, because silently destroying a resource other people are actively using must never be a side effect of an unrelated action.
- **Default-allow, not default-insert.** Nowhere in this schema does "no row" mean "no access." A missing permission-override row means fully allowed; a row only ever exists to *restrict*. This is what makes sharing take effect on all of a grantee's agents immediately, with zero rows written at share time.

### 8.2 Entity-relationship overview

```

### 8.3 Table specifications

#### `mcp_connectors` — the unified registry

One row per Composio integration or custom MCP server. `provider_type` says which; provider-specific columns are populated only for the matching type.

```sql
CREATE TABLE mcp_connectors (
    id                          UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    provider_type               TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (provider_type IN ('composio', 'mcp_server')),
    owner_id                    UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT,
    name                        TEXT NOT NULL,           -- display label only, NOT the tool-routing key
    display_name                TEXT,
    logo_url                    TEXT,
    description                 TEXT,

    -- Composio-only fields (NULL when provider_type = 'mcp_server')
    auth_config_id              TEXT,
    auth_scheme                 TEXT DEFAULT 'OAUTH2',
    use_composio_managed        BOOLEAN,

    -- MCP-server-only fields (NULL when provider_type = 'composio')
    url                          TEXT,
    transport                    TEXT DEFAULT 'streamable_http',
    auth_type                    TEXT CHECK (auth_type IN ('none','bearer','basic','oauth2','url_param')),
    url_param_name                TEXT,
    credential_header_name        TEXT DEFAULT 'Authorization',
    headers                       JSONB,
    is_active                     BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    oauth_authorization_endpoint  TEXT,
    oauth_token_endpoint          TEXT,
    oauth_client_id               TEXT,
    oauth_client_secret            TEXT,   -- encrypted at rest

    created_at                  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at                  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),

    CONSTRAINT chk_provider_fields CHECK (
        (provider_type = 'composio'  AND auth_config_id IS NOT NULL AND url IS NULL) OR
        (provider_type = 'mcp_server' AND url IS NOT NULL AND auth_config_id IS NULL)
    )
);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX uq_connectors_name_owner ON mcp_connectors(name, owner_id);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX uq_connectors_name_platform ON mcp_connectors(name) WHERE owner_id IS NULL;
CREATE INDEX idx_connectors_owner ON mcp_connectors(owner_id);
```

**Constraint rationale:** the CHECK is two-directional on purpose — it does not just forbid the wrong provider's fields from being filled in, it *requires* the right provider's required fields to be present. An earlier version of this constraint only enforced the first half, which would have allowed an empty, unusable connector (no URL, no auth config) to be inserted silently.

**Tool-routing note:** every tool exposed by an MCP-server connector is namespaced as `{prefix}__{tool_name}` when merged into an agent's tool list. That prefix is derived from `id`, **never from `name`** — `name` is unique only *within one owner's scope*, so once sharing exists, two different owners' connectors visible to the same grantee could legitimately share a `name`. An id-derived prefix cannot collide regardless of who owns what; `name` exists purely for display.

#### `mcp_connector_grants` — owner-controlled sharing

Mirrors the platform's existing agent-sharing pattern (`agent_grants`) rather than inventing a new shape.

```sql
CREATE TABLE mcp_connector_grants (
    id            UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    connector_id  UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES mcp_connectors(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    grant_type    TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (grant_type IN ('user', 'public')),
    grantee_id    TEXT NOT NULL,             -- a user id as text, or '*' meaning everyone
    granted_by    UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    created_at    TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),

    UNIQUE (connector_id, grant_type, grantee_id),
    CONSTRAINT chk_public_sentinel CHECK (
        (grant_type = 'public' AND grantee_id = '*') OR
        (grant_type != 'public' AND grantee_id != '*')
    )
);

CREATE INDEX idx_grants_grantee ON mcp_connector_grants(grantee_id, grant_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_grants_connector ON mcp_connector_grants(connector_id);
```

**Revocation must clean up, not just block.** Deleting a grant row correctly stops future access, but on its own leaves the grantee's stored credential (in `mcp_user_connections`) untouched. If the same connector is ever re-granted to that same person later, a stale, silently-reactivated credential would be a real problem. **Revoking a grant must, in the same transaction, also remove that grantee's connection row for the connector.**

#### `mcp_connector_tools` — the synced tool catalog

Persisted so permission-configuration screens render instantly without a live backend call.

```sql
CREATE TABLE mcp_connector_tools (
    id              UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    connector_id    UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES mcp_connectors(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    tool_name       TEXT NOT NULL,
    description     TEXT,
    default_stance  TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'allow' CHECK (default_stance IN ('allow','ask','block')),
    last_synced_at  TIMESTAMPTZ,

    UNIQUE (connector_id, tool_name)
);
```

`last_synced_at` exists so staleness is visible rather than silent — this catalog is a cache of what the live backend reports, not the enforcement source of truth (see §9.2).

#### `mcp_user_connections` — per-user credential/connection state

One row per (user, connector) covering every auth shape uniformly.

```sql
CREATE TABLE mcp_user_connections (
    id                        UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id                    UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    connector_id               UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES mcp_connectors(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    status                     TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('INITIATED','ACTIVE','EXPIRED')),

    -- Composio-flavored fields
    connected_account_id        TEXT,
    redirect_url                 TEXT,
    oauth_url                    TEXT,

    -- credential storage (format determined by joining to mcp_connectors.auth_type)
    encrypted_credential          TEXT,
    encrypted_refresh_token        TEXT,
    token_expires_at               TIMESTAMPTZ,
    scope                          TEXT,

    created_at                  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at                  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),

    UNIQUE (user_id, connector_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_user_connections_user ON mcp_user_connections(user_id);
```

**No `credential_type` column, deliberately.** An earlier draft stored the auth format on this row too — but it is fully determined by joining to `mcp_connectors.auth_type` and could never legitimately disagree with it. Storing it twice was pure duplication; the credential-formatting code joins to the connector instead.

#### `mcp_composio_sessions` — Composio's durable session id

Composio's own "Tool Router" session concept has no equivalent on the custom-server side, so it is intentionally kept separate rather than forced into a shared shape.

```sql
CREATE TABLE mcp_composio_sessions (
    id                    UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id                UUID NOT NULL UNIQUE REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    composio_session_id    TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at            TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at            TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

Nothing about *which toolkits are currently connected* is cached here — that is derived live from `mcp_user_connections` on demand, so the two can never drift out of sync.

#### `mcp_agent_connector_access` — the permission override layer

```sql
CREATE TABLE mcp_agent_connector_access (
    id             UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id         UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,   -- the caller, not necessarily the agent's owner
    agent_id        UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES agents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    connector_id    UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES mcp_connectors(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    enabled         BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
    tool_rules      JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]',   -- [{ "pattern": "SEND_*", "stance": "block" }, ...]
    created_at      TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at      TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),

    UNIQUE (user_id, agent_id, connector_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_access_user_agent ON mcp_agent_connector_access(user_id, agent_id);
```

**The single most important rule in the entire schema:** the absence of a row for a (user, agent, connector) triple means fully allowed. A row only ever exists to *restrict* — disable the whole connector for that agent, or apply specific allow/ask/block rules. This is what makes "share once, every one of the grantee's agents gets it" true with zero rows written at share time.

**Known tradeoff:** collapsing what was previously two tables' worth of one-row-per-rule storage into a single `tool_rules` JSONB array loses a database-level uniqueness guarantee that used to prevent two conflicting rules for the same tool pattern. Application code is now responsible for validating and de-duplicating rules before writing them — the database will not catch a contradictory array on its own.

**Implementation-order rule (security-critical, not a schema detail):** this table must never be consulted on its own. Every access check evaluates ownership/grant status *first* (§12); only if that passes does this table's rules get applied. An `enabled = true` row here must never grant access by itself if the underlying grant was revoked.

## 9. Request Flows

### 9.1 `tools/list` — aggregation, filtering, caching

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Agent
    participant M as MCP Route Handler
    participant P as Permission Engine (Redis-cached)
    participant S as Connector Resolver
    participant C as Manifest Cache (Redis)
    participant B as Backends (Composio + custom servers)

    A->>M: {method: "tools/list"} + resolved identity
    M->>P: Load permission context (user, agent) → hash
    M->>S: Resolve every connector this user can see AND is connected to
    M->>C: Lookup cached manifest (keyed on connector set + permission hash)
    alt cache hit
        C-->>M: Cached merged tool list
    else cache miss
        M->>B: Fan out tools/list concurrently to every resolved connector
        B-->>M: Per-connector tool lists
        M->>M: Namespace MCP-server tools by connector id, filter by permission stance
        M->>C: Store merged result (short TTL)
    end
    M-->>A: Merged, permission-filtered tool list
```

The manifest cache key is bound to **both** the caller's current connector set *and* their current permission hash. Either changing — a new connection, a revoked grant, an edited rule — changes the key, so a stale answer can never be served; there is no "wait a few minutes for it to catch up."

### 9.2 `tools/call` — routing and enforcement

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Agent
    participant M as MCP Route Handler
    participant P as Permission Engine
    participant BK as Target Backend

    A->>M: {method: "tools/call", name, arguments}
    M->>M: route_tool(name) → resolve target connector + original tool name
    M->>P: Re-check: connector visible to caller? enabled for this agent? tool stance?
    alt blocked
        M-->>A: Error — tool blocked
    else ask
        M-->>A: Error — approval required
    else allowed
        M->>BK: Forward call with the caller's own injected credentials
        BK-->>M: Result
        M->>M: Record usage + telemetry
        M-->>A: Result
    end
```

The permission check is repeated in full at call time, not only at list time — this closes the window where a tool could be listed as available and then blocked a moment before it's actually invoked.

### 9.3 Connecting a connector (unified across auth types)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    REQ[Connect request] --> T{Connector's auth type}
    T -->|Composio| CO["Initiate Composio OAuth
    → return authorization URL
    → record INITIATED connection"]
    T -->|bearer / basic / url_param| CR["Store per-user credential
    (encrypted) → connected immediately"]
    T -->|oauth2 custom server| OD["Discover OAuth endpoints (once per server)
    → PKCE + signed state
    → return authorization URL"]
    T -->|none| OK[Connected immediately]
    OD --> CB["OAuth callback:
    verify state → exchange code
    → store encrypted tokens"]
    CO --> CB2["Composio callback:
    verify ACTIVE status
    → record connected-account id"]
```

### 9.4 Sharing a custom MCP server

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant O as Owner
    participant M as MCP Gateway
    participant G as Grantee

    O->>M: Register a custom MCP server
    M->>M: Insert connector, owner_id = O — private, visible only to O
    Note over O: All of the owner's own agents already have access — no extra row needed
    O->>M: Share by username
    M->>M: Resolve username → user id, insert one grant row
    Note over M: Done — no other table touched
    G->>M: "Connectors I can use" query
    M-->>G: Now includes the shared connector
    G->>M: Connect with own credentials
    M->>M: Insert mcp_user_connections row for (G, connector)
    Note over G: Every agent G owns already has access — same default-allow rule applies
```

### 9.5 Revoking a share

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    REV[Owner revokes grant] --> DEL1[Delete grant row]
    DEL1 --> DEL2["Delete grantee's mcp_user_connections
    row for this connector — same transaction"]
    DEL2 --> INV["Invalidate any cached permission/manifest
    entries for that grantee"]
    INV --> RESULT["Grantee loses access immediately AND
    any re-grant later requires reconnecting from scratch"]
```

### 9.6 Permission change → immediate cache invalidation

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI
    participant M as Permissions Route
    participant R as Redis

    UI->>M: Update tool rules for (user, agent, connector)
    M->>M: Upsert mcp_agent_connector_access row
    M->>R: Invalidate permission cache for (user, agent)
    Note over M,R: Next tools/list recomputes the permission hash →<br/>manifest cache key changes → fresh filtered list, no delay
```

### 9.7 Composio token-expiry webhook

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    CW[Composio webhook: token expired] --> V[Verify HMAC signature]
    V --> E[Mark connection EXPIRED for that account]
    E --> INV[Invalidate cached session/connection state for that user]
```

## 10. Auth Types & Credential Injection

The gateway supports every authentication shape a custom MCP server might require, resolved uniformly at request time from `mcp_user_connections` joined against `mcp_connectors.auth_type`:

| Auth type | Injection | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `none` | Nothing | — |
| `bearer` | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (or a custom header name) | Auto-prefixed with `Bearer` if the stored value omits it |
| `basic` | `Authorization: Basic <base64(user:pass)>` | Base64-encoded automatically on connect |
| `url_param` | `?<param>=<value>` appended to the request URL | Never exposed in headers |
| `oauth2` | `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` | Automatically refreshed when close to expiry, using the stored refresh token |
| Composio | Resolved MCP session URL + headers from the active Composio session | Managed entirely by Composio's OAuth infrastructure |

Credentials are loaded in two batched queries per request (no N+1 pattern) — one for user connections, one for OAuth tokens — and a connector with no credential/token stored for the calling user is silently skipped rather than causing the whole request to fail.

---

## 11. Caching Strategy

All caching lives in Redis, shared across every server replica (this is a horizontally-scaled service — an in-process cache would be inconsistent across instances). Every key is namespaced:

| Cache | Key shape | Invalidated by |
|---|---|---|
| Permission context | keyed by (user, agent) | Any write to `mcp_agent_connector_access` for that pair |
| Connector/session resolution | keyed by user | Any connect / disconnect / grant / revoke / webhook event for that user |
| Merged tool manifest | keyed by (connector set fingerprint, permission hash) | Automatically — either component changing changes the key itself |

The permission hash is the mechanism that ties cache correctness to actual state: it's a deterministic digest of every active rule and disabled-connector flag for a (user, agent) pair. Any meaningful change recomputes to a different hash, which is itself the manifest cache's key component — there is no separate "please also remember to invalidate the manifest cache" step to forget.

---

## 12. Permission Model — Deep Dive

Every access decision resolves through exactly two layers, checked strictly in this order:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    START[Caller requests a tool] --> L1{"Layer 1:
    Can this caller reach this connector at all?"}
    L1 -->|Composio: always yes| L2
    L1 -->|Owner of the connector: yes| L2
    L1 -->|Live grant exists for them or '*': yes| L2
    L1 -->|None of the above| DENY1[Hidden entirely — not even visible]
    L2{"Layer 2:
    Enabled for this specific agent? Tool allowed?"}
    L2 -->|No row exists| ALLOW["Allowed
    (default-allow — no row means no restriction)"]
    L2 -->|Row exists, enabled=false| DENY2[Connector disabled for this agent]
    L2 -->|Row exists, tool stance = block| DENY3[Tool blocked]
    L2 -->|Row exists, tool stance = ask| ASKAPPROVAL[Requires approval]
    L2 -->|Row exists, tool stance = allow| ALLOW
```

**Why the ordering is security-critical, not just logical:** Layer 2 must never be evaluated independently of Layer 1. If an implementation ever asks "is there an `enabled=true` row?" without first re-confirming that Layer 1 currently passes, a revoked grant that left behind a stale permissive row would continue to let someone in — precisely the failure mode a revocation flow must never have. Layer 1 gates whether Layer 2 is even consulted, on every single check, with no shortcut path.

---

## 13. Composio Integration

Composio exposes no native Rust SDK, so integration is a direct HTTP client against Composio's own versioned API, built entirely behind the `ToolProvider` trait so it can be mocked in tests and swapped for an alternative implementation if needed. The client covers:

- **Auth-config registration** — registering a toolkit's OAuth application with Composio.
- **Connection initiation** — starting a user's OAuth flow and returning the authorization URL.
- **Connection status sync** — resolving Composio's connected-account id and current status.
- **Revocation** — disconnecting a user's account from a toolkit.
- **Tool Router session lifecycle** — creating, reusing, and patching the per-user session that Composio's aggregated MCP endpoint is served through, and resolving the session URL and headers needed to reach it.

All requests authenticate with a single platform-level API key; response parsing is deliberately tolerant of minor shape variation across Composio's endpoints, since the exact envelope for some responses is not fully documented — this isolation is exactly why the trait boundary exists: a shape correction only ever touches the Composio client, nothing else in the system.

---

## 14. Observability & Usage Integration

Every tool call is recorded into the platform's existing observability and usage-tracking sinks — nothing about MCP tool calls requires a new dashboard or a new query surface:

- **Usage tracking** — every successful or failed tool call is recorded with its operation type, the acting agent, latency, and outcome, feeding into the platform's existing per-user/per-agent usage reporting and cost attribution.
- **Metrics** — tool-call counters and latency histograms carry the tool name and agent identity as attributes, consistent with the platform's broader generative-AI metrics.
- **Distributed tracing** — the same `traceparent` that authorizes the call also keeps it on the originating trace, so a tool call taken during a multi-agent conversation remains attributable end to end.

---

## 15. Extension Seams

Following the platform's established pattern of trait-based extension points rather than forked code paths:

| Trait / seam | Implementation |
|---|---|
| `ToolProvider` | Composio client, custom-MCP-server client |
| `ConnectorAuthorizer` | Owner ∪ user/public-grant reachability check (Layer 1) |
| Instrumentation injector | Injects the fixed gateway URL at deploy time |
| Management-route access gate | Owner / public-grant / platform-admin checks |

No new authentication scheme is introduced for management routes — they reuse the same access-control primitives the rest of the platform's resource-management routes already use. Extended behavior on these seams — including team- and department-scoped connector sharing — is available in the Nasiko enterprise edition.

---

## 16. Configuration Reference

| Setting | Purpose | Default behavior when unset |
|---|---|---|
| Composio API key | Enables Composio integration | Composio features cleanly disabled, custom MCP servers unaffected |
| Composio base URL | Composio API endpoint | Sensible default pointing at Composio's production API |
| Composio webhook secret | HMAC verification for the expiry webhook | Webhook processing disabled if unset |
| Gateway public URL | Injected into every agent as `MCP_GATEWAY_URL` | Agents deployed without it cannot reach the gateway until redeployed |
| Agent gateway token | Minted per agent at deploy, injected as `MCP_GATEWAY_TOKEN` (rotates on every redeploy) | Always minted — no configuration; a restart re-mints it |
| Session cache TTL | How long a resolved connector/session set is cached | Short, tuned for responsiveness over cache-hit rate |
| Permission cache TTL | How long a permission context is cached before re-checking | Short — any write-path event invalidates it immediately regardless |
| Manifest cache TTL | How long a merged tool list is cached | Moderate — bounded by the permission/connector hash changing anyway |

A CLI-bound coding-agent row, which is never deployed, gets the agent gateway token above minted
on demand instead — minted by its owner via `POST /api/agents/{id}/mcp-token`, revoked by the
owner or a superuser via `DELETE`.

---

## 17. API Surface

**Agent-facing (bearer gateway token + flow-bound user identity, one endpoint):**

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/mcp` | The single MCP JSON-RPC entry point — `initialize`, `ping`, `tools/list`, `tools/call` |

| POST | `/api/mcp/webhooks/composio` | Public, HMAC-verified — Composio token-expiry events |

Public paths (the OAuth callback and the Composio webhook) authenticate via signed state or HMAC rather than a session JWT.

## 18. Security Hardening Summary

The schema and access model described above reflect a completed adversarial review, not the first draft. Five concrete issues were found and fixed before this became the decided design:

| # | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Tool-name prefixing based on `name`, which is only unique per owner — two different owners' connectors visible to the same grantee could collide once sharing exists | Prefix derived from `id` instead, which can never collide |
| 2 | Revoking a share blocked future access but left the grantee's stored credential untouched, risking silent reactivation on a later re-grant | Revocation now deletes the grantee's connection row in the same transaction |
| 3 | The provider-type constraint only forbade the wrong provider's fields, never required the right provider's fields — an empty, unusable connector could be inserted | Constraint tightened to require the correct fields, not just forbid the incorrect ones |
| 4 | `credential_type` was stored on every connection row despite being fully derivable from the connector's own `auth_type` | Column removed; credential formatting joins to the connector instead |
| 5 | Deleting a connector owner cascaded to silently destroy the connector — and everyone else's shared access to it | Changed to a blocking delete — ownership must be transferred or the connector explicitly deleted first |

Two accepted, documented tradeoffs remain: application code, not the database, is responsible for de-duplicating conflicting tool rules within the `tool_rules` array, and the two-layer permission check (§12) must always be evaluated in order — this is called out explicitly here so it is never lost in an unrelated ticket description.
